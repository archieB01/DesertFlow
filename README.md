# DesertFlow
DesertFlow is a ML model which uses historical water data from the past 60 years from the Novajo Nation(https://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/hydrodata/reservoir_data/920/dashboard.html) and leverages the data to predict a date for when the water reservoir would run out of water supply if the current trend of water consumption were followed.
